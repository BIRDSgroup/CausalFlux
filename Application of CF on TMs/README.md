# Guide for this section

This section provides information on the following:

1) **Applying methods on TMs (Toy Models)**
The **CF** folder contains code/data for applying CF on the TMs. Look at the "README.md" file in this folder for more details
2) **Simulations**
This section provides codes/data for generating the steady-state fluxes and gene expression data for TMs modelled throufgh system of ODEs. Look at the "README.md" file in this folder for more details
