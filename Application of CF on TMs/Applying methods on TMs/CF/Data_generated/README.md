# Guide to the results generated

1) There are three folders: **TM1**, **TM2**, and **TM3**
   
2) Each of these folders contains
   
   (i) the simulated actual and predicted flux values for the TMs under various exchange rates (3.2, 320, and  3200) for all WT/gene KO cases - "Actual_Pred_data"
        - these files contains the actual/GT values form the ODE simulations of the TMs 
        - these files contains the predicted fluxes for CF-S (FVA and FBA implementation), CF-MTR (FVA and FBA implementation), TRIMER, and GIMME (FVA and FBA implementation)
   
   (ii) the correlation between the actual and predicted flux values for the TMs under various exchange rates (3.2, 320, and  3200) for all WT/gene KO cases - "Cor_PV_RMSE_data"
        - the predicted fluxes include CF-S (FVA and FBA implementation), CF-MTR (FVA and FBA implementation), TRIMER, and GIMME (FVA and FBA implementation)
