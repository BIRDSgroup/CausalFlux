# Simulation Analysis

This section contains two folders:
1) **Codes**
   
   This contains all the necessary codes and required data to generate the outputs in the **Data Generated** folder. The codes/parameters to run the ODE simulations for the TMs to generate steady-state fluxes and gene expression data is given here. The *README.md* file inside this folder explains the implentation details.
3) **Data Generated**
   
   This folder contains all the simulated fluxes and gene expression data for the toy models. The "**Flux_Simulations**" folder contains all the steady-state fluxes generated for the three toy models under the 3.2, 320, 3200 exchange rates for the WT/gene KO cases. The "**Gene_Exp_Simulations**" folder contains all the gene expression data generated for the three toy models under the 3.2, 320, 3200 exchange rates for the WT/gene KO cases.
