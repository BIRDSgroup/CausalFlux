## Section 1: Our CF framework
This section presents the code for the CF-S and CF-MTR frameworks, applicable to any generic case. It includes information on the datasets required and the function arguments. A detailed methodology is described in our paper.

## Section 2: Application of CF framework on the toy models
This section provides the following information:
1) Codes/data for simulating the steady-state fluxes and gene expression data in the three TMs for the WT/KO cases under all the exchange rates.
2) Codes/data for running the CF-S/MTR, TRIMER, and GIMME approach on the TMs.
3) Codes/data for generating the necessary figures in the manuscript and supplemenatry material.

## Section 3: Application of CF framework on the real-world data
