# Instructions to run "DO_KO.R" script

1) The "Double_KO_CF_S" function will take two genes as inputs to perform double knockouts. Arguments "xun" and "xum" in the function will take the two genes to be KO. CF-S implementation is followed here.

2) Other files such as the ".m" scripts, ".mat" file and other data folders are same as the CF-S implementation of _E. coli_ (check the README file in that folder)

3) Change line 1261 in the "DO_KO.R" script to the working directory where all the other files (from CF-S implementation of _E. coli_) are present. It is here the final result will be stored as well

4) Change line 1263 to perform double KOs on other genes (example is given here)
